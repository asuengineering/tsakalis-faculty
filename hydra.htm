<i><font color="#990000">INTRO</font></i>
<p>The construction of a simple walking biped presents an interesting
problem
in controls, as well as
<br>
in engineering design.&nbsp; From the engineering design point of view,
the bipedal motion should be
<br>
simple enough for the project to be feasible within an academic
semester.
Still, it should be more
<br>
challenging than that of a toy robot.
</p>
<p>Beginning with such a loose objective ("let's make something that
walks
on two legs"), one quickly
<br>
gains appreciation of the connections between feedback control theory
and the natural, instinctive,
<br>
action of walking. In particular, the classical inverted pendulum
system
appears as a core component
<br>
in bipedal walking. Imitating the human bipedal walk, however, is
fairly
complicated; it requires
<br>
ankle, knee and, possibly, waist joints, 2-dimensional stabilization.
<br>
(Here, one also learns a new respect for back problems).

<i><font color="#990000">THE HYDRAPOD CONCEPT</font></i>
<p>The Hydrapod performs its awkward bipedal motion on a straight line
and uses only 1-DOF
<br>
ankle and waist joints.&nbsp; Each joint motion is controlled by a
servomotor.&nbsp; Two more servomotors
<br>
are used to move balancing weights on each leg. The walking motion
is a sequence of three basic
<br>
phases (vertical stabilization, step, exchange of planted foot; see
the following schematic for details).

<i><font color="#990000">ON NUMERICAL SIMULATION</font></i>
<p>A study of the hydrapod's motion was conducted by implementing a
simplified
nonlinear model in
<br>
SIMULINK.&nbsp; The simulation of the motion provided insight on the
stability/performance
<br>
requirements of the controllers, the effect of the various
nonlinearities
on the feedback loops,
<br>
the servomotor power requirements and the achievable angular
velocities.
<br>
(The following picture shows the outer layer of the simulator.)

<i><font color="#990000">MAKING MOVIES</font></i>
<p>Two video clips are provided in the links below, showing the
execution
of one step. The reference
<br>
angle commands to execute the step are issued manually, leaving plenty
of room for improvement,
<br>
automation via computer control etc. Autonomy of motion is also left
to the future. In fact the
<br>
Hydrapod uses banks of AA batteries as balancing weights, in
anticipation
of meeting the power
<br>
needs of autonomous motion.&nbsp; Finally, as a first video production,
it suffers from the usual lack of
<br>
sufficient lighting, background, and all the not-so-special
effects.&nbsp;
Still, George Lucas beware!
