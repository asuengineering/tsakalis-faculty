<h3> Abstract</h3>
This work provides an integrated approach for modeling and robust
multivariable controller design, with application to temperature
control of diffusion and CVD furnaces. Modeling relies on input-output
data, collected in a preliminary identification experiment at the
desired operating conditions. An important component of the
identification is the computation of uncertainty bounds that describe
the confidence limits of the model, in a manner consistent with robust
control theory. The results of the identification are then used to
design an H-infinity controller with a cascade, hierarchical structure.
The final implementation of the controller also includes mechanisms to
prevent integrator wind-up. Special emphasis is placed on automating
the procedure --for classes of furnaces-- so that, potentially, it can
be used by non-experts on the field. Implementations include several
industrial furnaces. Experimental results demonstrate the success of
the approach as well as the good agreement between predicted and actual
closed-loop behavior.&nbsp;
