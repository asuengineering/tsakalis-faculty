<h3> Abstract</h3>
  The objective of this project is to employ systematic methods from systems
 and control theory in the modeling, analysis and controller design for the 
scheduling of semiconductor manufacturing operations. A key component is the
understanding of the scheduling problem complexity induced by presence  of
nonlinear dynamics (re-entry, batching, machine set-ups, multiple products,
 preventive maintenance etc.)  
<p>The basic framework of our modeling and controller design approach is
the natural time-scale decomposition associated with the various decision
levels. At a fast time-scale, decisions are made regarding the assignment
of resources, operation of individual machines, release of material into
the production line, maintenance etc. At a slower time-scale, one is concerned
with the average characteristics of production and the overall optimization
of the fab operation. An advantage of this modeling approach lies in its
ability to bring in control-theoretic concepts of uncertainty description,
model aggregation, assessment of closed-loop model fidelity etc. Furthermore,
the decomposition of the control problem in terms of slow and fast time-scales
 can allow for a scalable and more efficient exploitation of structural system 
properties. Inner-loop controllers, operating on a fast time-scale, can take 
into account the process nonlinear dynamics and define operating trajectories 
that trade-off variability minimization, cycle-time minimization and throughput 
maximization in a locally optimal way. On the other hand, outer-loop controllers 
operate in a slow time-scale and can optimize the average production behavior 
more efficiently, by taking into account low-frequency variabilities, e.g., 
preventive maintenance. </p>
 
<p>The focus of this project is on the design of outer-loop scheduling policies 
(slow time-scales) while inner-loop (fast time-scale) considerations are addressed
in the <a href="http://math.la.asu.edu/%7Ekawski/manufact.html">related project.</a>
